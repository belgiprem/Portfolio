++ Objective - To analyse the Covid-19 dataset from Kaggle and provide answers to the following questions:-
1. What is the total number of active cases?
2. What is the Recovery rate and Mortality rate?
3. What are the top 10 states with active cases, highest death count?
4. What are the top 5 affected states in India?
5. How does the ratio of male and female vaccined compare?
6. Which is the states with most and least vaccinated individuals?

### STEPS:

* Inspected the data in Excel and took note on missing values and discrepancies in data.
* Imported necessary librarioes in python, like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
* Imported the files.
* Viewed the file.
* Used info function to view information of the files.
* Used describe function to get a glimpse of count, mean, min, max etc.
* Dropped the columns that we don't require.
* Changed format of date column.
* Found total number of active cases which is confirmed - (cured + death).
* Created Pivot Table with Mortality rate (total no of death/total no of confirmed *100) and recovery rate (total no of cured / total no of confirmed *100).
* Sorted the Pivot table by cases column in descending order.
* Plotted Bar graph for top 10 states with most active cases in India.
* Plotted Bar graph for top 10 states with most deaths in India.
* Plotted line graph for top 5 affected states in India.
* R
